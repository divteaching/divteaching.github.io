        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a Computer Science undergraduate student at UC Davis with a strong interest in software engineering, compiler design, and applied AI systems. I’ve built several full-stack platforms that bring together modern backend infrastructure and scalable frontend systems. Beyond building, I’m passionate about teaching software engineering by sharing practical insights from real development experience to help others grow as engineers.

        <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            I believe in a hands-on approach to teaching that integrates version control, collaborative software engineering, and real-world development practices. My goal is to equip students with practical experience using professional tools while fostering confidence in their technical abilities.
